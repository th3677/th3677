## 🔐 Introduction
I am deeply interested in **infrastructure security, cloud systems, and threat intelligence**, with a focus on how modern environments are **designed, secured, monitored, and defended**.

I’m particularly drawn to:
- How attackers exploit cloud and infrastructure weaknesses  
- How security telemetry (logs, alerts, signals) can be used to detect real threats  
- How automation and secure design reduce risk at scale  

I enjoy working across the full security lifecycle — from **secure architecture and Infrastructure as Code** to **logging, monitoring, and detection**.
