## 🔐 Introduction
I am deeply interested in **infrastructure security, cloud systems, and threat intelligence**, with a focus on how modern environments are **designed, secured, monitored, and defended**.

I’m particularly drawn to:
- How attackers exploit cloud and infrastructure weaknesses  
- How security telemetry (logs, alerts, signals) can be used to detect real threats  
- How automation and secure design reduce risk at scale  

I enjoy working across the full security lifecycle — from **secure architecture and Infrastructure as Code** to **logging, monitoring, and detection**.

## 🎯 Career Direction
I am pursuing an **entry-level role in Infrastructure Security, Cloud Security, or Security Operations**, where I can:
- Design and secure cloud infrastructure
- Automate security controls using Infrastructure as Code
- Analyze security telemetry and threat signals
- Support incident response and detection engineering efforts

Long-term, I aim to specialize in **securing large-scale cloud systems** and applying **threat intelligence** to improve defensive architecture and detection capabilities.
